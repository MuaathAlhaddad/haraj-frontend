      <b>Pay cash</b> <br />
      In online classifieds, it's best to pay cash and to keep the payment
      simple. Do not use personal checks, money wires, Western Union or
      Moneygrams. Do not give out any personally identifiable information such
      as bank numbers or credit card numbers. Terms.<br /><br />
      <b>For big purchases, use cashier's checks</b> <br />
      For big purchases, use cashier's checks. <br /><br />
      <b>Protect your personally identifiable information</b> <br />
      . Don't give out your social security number, bank numbers, credit card
      numbers, etc. If someone like a landlord asks for your social security
      number, give them a copy of your credit report instead, with your social
      security number blacked out. If the seller seems evasive or suspicious or
      makes you uncomfortable at any point during the transaction, walk away
      from the deal. Always trust your instincts.
      <br /><br />
      <b>"Do it in person and do it in public."</b> <br />
      If you follow this mantra, you should be safe. But sometimes a scammer
      will have a convincing scam up their sleeve, which is why you should also
      follow these additional precautions. Be extra cautious of people who make
      up reasons for why they suddenly can't meet in person and pressure you to
      decide fast, especially if shipping to a foreign country is involved.<br /><br />
      <b>Sellers</b> <br />
      • Beware of checks. It takes a few weeks for your bank to notify you that
      you deposited a fake check. It's best to go to the bank with the buyer and
      get a cashier's check issued in person.
      <br />• Never accept extra payment with complicated excuses. <br />• Never
      send a portion of the money back to the buyer, a shipping agent, or any
      other person. <br /><br />
